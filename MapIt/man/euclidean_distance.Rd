\title{Calculates the Euclidean distance between two points.}
\usage{
euclidean_distance(point1, point2)
}
\arguments{
\item{point1}{A vector representing the first point (longitude, latitude).}

\item{point2}{A vector representing the second point (longitude, latitude).}
}
\value{
The Euclidean distance between the two points
}
\description{
This function computes the Euclidean distance between two points.
The points are represented as coordinate pairs (longitude, latitude).
}
\examples{
point1 <- c(-75, 40)
point2 <- c(-80, 45)
distance <- euclidean_distance(point1, point2)
print(distance)
